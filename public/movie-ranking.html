<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love Christopher Nolan and his Masterpiece.</p>
<h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>I love Matt Reeve's take on the Caped Crusader.</p>
<h3>Downfall (2004)</h3>
<p>A surprising and unexpected masterpiece. Loved the shades of Hitler in his final days in his bunker, Bruno Ganz succeeds to bring out the mannerism and expressions of hitler during the downfall of berlin.</p>
